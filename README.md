# VARCO TTS 

## VARCO TTS Lite
VARCO TTS LITE is a low-latency, high-throughput engine for large-scale real-time speech synthesis. It offers a wide range of voices optimized for in-game characters—NPCs, avatars, and story narration—while keeping audio quality stable and consistent across sessions.

To avoid issues often seen in AR (autoregressive) models, such as irregular pronunciation or instability in audio quality, the system tightly controls pitch, duration, and energy prediction, and applies deterministic synthesis to deliver the same quality every time.

## VARCO TTS Standard
VARCO TTS STANDARD is a generative speech model that delivers vivid, dynamic voice synthesis. Unlike conventional TTS, which produces the same output for the same input, the system uses sampling techniques so the same text can be rendered with different intonation, rhythm, and expressions each time. This results in non-repetitive speech that feels varied and human-like, enhancing immersion.

Additionally, it pairs studio-grade audio quality with dynamic prosody, making it suitable for a wide range of global use cases—including games, storytelling, and media localization.
